Welcome to LaunchTime
=====================

Lunchtime is about reducing the overhead and stress related to the decision of where to eat at launch-time.
It includes a web based mobile interface and some basic voting functionality. 

In lieu of increasing demand, The Gifts Project labs team (http://labs.giftsproject.com) has just opensourced this project to allow other great teams to use and extend it (i.e. Face.com)

We will soon post more reasonable documentation on how to use this project and some future suggestion.
